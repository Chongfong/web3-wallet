## Note

The feature 4 Transaction Monitoring is not implemented,
I have trouble getting the Testnet assets,
and the value of BitCoin and USD is made by mock data.
the Ethereum's amount and value would be right.

## Quick Start

2. Run the cmd: `npm install` or `npm i`.
3. Run the cmd: `npm run start`.
